# Port Navigation Simulation with GAMA

## Description
This project is a multi-agent port navigation simulation developed using the GAMA Platform. It enables the simulation and analysis of maritime traffic in a port environment.

## Features
- Maritime traffic simulation in port areas
- Ship collision management
- Route planning and optimization
- Real-time vessel movement visualization
- Interactive user interface

## Prerequisites
- GAMA Platform 1.9.1 or higher
- Java JDK 11 or higher
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- Disk space: 500MB

## Installation
1. Install GAMA Platform from [official website](https://gama-platform.org/)
2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PRISCILLE7/-GAMA-Simulation-Port-Navigation.git
```
3. Open GAMA and import the project
